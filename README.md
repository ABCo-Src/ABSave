# ABSave

ABSave is a blazing-fast binary serializer, with an output size smaller than any other, powered by live IL injection and (in the future) source generation.

ABSave outputs to an extremely compact binary format known as "ABSave", which is built to be both quick to read, as well as extremely closely packed and small. It scales up to very large data sets very well.

In addition, unlike other binary serializers of the same kind, ABSave includes a carefully built "versioning" system, allowing ever evolving and changing classes to still be stored and read even when the data structures inevitably change, and it's achieved with almost no effect on the output size.

Try it out! You might just like it!

## Get going

ABSave has dozens of things internally that allow it to achieve such a high speed and such a small output size, and all of that happens from only a few lines of code!

Take a look at the "Getting Started" section of the official documentation to get going quickly: https://abco.live/docs/absave

## Coming soon
**ABSave is currently still under heavy development and more information will be added to this README as it develops!**

#### By ABCo
ABSave is developed as an open-source library for anyone to use and its parent project is "ABCo". Feel free to join the ABCo Discord server to discuss ABSave or other ABCo projects!

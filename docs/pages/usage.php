    <p>This part of the documentation will tell you how to use all the features of the official converter for ABSave. It does not tell you how the <a href="#" data-navigates="alongside" data-navigateTo="Binary Output">binary output is structured</a>, nor how ABSave internally works, but simply how to use it.<br><br>
    <p>You'll find all the smaller parts within this section simply by expanding it in the menu.</p>

    <p>If you don't have access to a class (so you can't add attributes), then don't worry! Everything you can communicate with attributes you can also communicate via the settings. It's not <i>quite</i> as elegant but still perfectly easy to do!</p>

    <div class="msgBox warningBox">
        <h4 class="noAnchor">Note</h4>
        <p>You should read the <a href="#" data-navigates="exact" data-navigateTo="Using ABSave>Settings.customizing">customize section</a> of the settings guide (in addition to the quick start guide) before reading anything in here!</p>
    </div>
    <p>This page describes how to map via settings.</p>
